HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating and structuring content on the web. It forms the backbone of most websites, providing the structure that allows web browsers to display text, images, links, and multimedia. HTML is essential for web development and works in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites.

<h3> Basic Structure of HTML </h3>

<p>
An HTML document is made up of elements, each represented by tags. Here's a very simple example of a basic HTML page:
</p>
<h2> Key Components of an HTML Page: </h2>
<p> 
DOCTYPE Declaration:
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document. It helps ensure the page is rendered correctly.

<html> Tag:
This is the root element that contains all the content of the page.

<head> Tag:
The <head> element contains meta-information about the page, such as:

    <meta charset="UTF-8">: Defines the character encoding.
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Ensures the page is responsive on mobile devices.
    <title>: Sets the title of the page that appears in the browser tab.

<body> Tag:
This is where the content visible to users is placed. It includes elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.

Common HTML Tags:

    <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.: Used for headings. <h1> is the most important heading, and <h6> is the least.
    <p>: Defines a paragraph of text.
    <a href="URL">: Creates a hyperlink to another webpage or resource.
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="description">: Displays an image. The src attribute defines the image path, and the alt attribute provides a text alternative.
    <ul>, <ol>, <li>: Used for unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists.
    <div>: A generic container used to group elements together.
    <span>: A generic inline container, used for styling small portions of text or content.
